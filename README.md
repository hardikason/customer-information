DEVELOPMENT TASK

The task below has been created to give candidates the opportunity to demonstrate both their front-end and back-end development skills as well as their general understanding of web-development best practices.

REQUIREMENT

Build a module which a customer can use to view information stored by Ruroc. This information should be visible on a new page accessible within their account area and should display:

• Any orders and corresponding order information. • Any personal details we store against that customer. • A link which allows customers to request this information is deleted.

The last point complies with a GDPR right to erasure request. It should send an email to a system configured email address to notify us the customer wants us to remove their personal information.

The page should be styled as closely as possible to the Ruroc.com styling.
